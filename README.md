# IV1351 Data Storage Paradigms
Project work in group in course IV1351 at KTH Kista. The project was about building a smaller application where the user could use it as an 
information system to view information about the guides and the guided tours of a fictional art museum stored in a database.

The program is written in Java and the graphical interface uses JavaFX. The database is a MySQL database.
